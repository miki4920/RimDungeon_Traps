# RimDungeon Traps
Welcome to RimDungeon! 

RimDungeon is a collection of mods allowing you to play a dungeon keeper, instead of Rim coloniser.
This specific mod adds a variety of traps, so you can embrace your truest kobold desires. Adding your own traps is easy due to a versatile framework available with the mod.
But obviously you want to get to traps. At his point, following ones have been created.
## Primitive Traps
Primitive Traps are the most basic ones you will have access to. They require a very cheap research.
### Caltrops
A bundle of spiked stars spread across a tile. Whilst they are far from deadly, they are painful enough so that most creatures thread through them carefully, slowing them down significantly.

### Oil Trap
Wood Log soaked in oil and wrapped in clothing. Causes a small explosion of fire on trigger. Cheap, unreliable and ineffective against fast moving targets. Devastating against slow creatures.

No effect against fast enemies:

Whereas a slow one is quite heavily damaged:

## Animal Traps
Those traps are focused more around killing and weakening animals. Whilst they can be used against humans, it's rather ineffective.
### Bear Trap
Whilst usually used against bears, this trap can be effectively used against a variety of animals, or even humans. It does a decent amount of piercing damage, and gives a long-term movement penalty but requires metal to make.

## Noose Trap
A noose trap. Whilst damage might be enough to kill small animals, its main benefit is ability to immobilise target for a long time in a noose. Humans are unlikely to trigger it.

## Advanced Traps
A much more advanced traps, requiring a great deal of knowledge and skill to set up correctly.
### Spike Trap
Five spikes under tension, connected to a touch-activated trigger. When the victim disturbs the trigger, the spikes spring forth and strike the victim.

### Spikes Trap
Spikes hidden in the ground. When triggered, spikes thrust into the enemy, doing massive, armour piercing damage. Rearmable but is expensive and takes a long time to build. It is unlikely to trigger on colonists or animals.

### Poison Trap
WARNING: This is a extremely deadly poison trap, disguised as a plant. The poison works on touch, is single use, but is guaranteed to kill any affected creature within a very short time period.

A faulty column, rigged to fall apart when an enemy touches it. The column can also be destroyed manually.
