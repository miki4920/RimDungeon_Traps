# RimDungeon Traps
Welcome to RimDungeon! 

RimDungeon is a collection of mods allowing you to play a dungeon keeper, instead of Rim coloniser.
This specific mod adds a variety of traps, so you can embrace your truest kobold desires. Adding your own traps is easy due to a versatile framework available with the mod.
But obviously you want to get to traps. At his point, following ones have been created.
## Primitive Traps
Primitive Traps are the most basic ones you will have access to. They require a very cheap research.
### Caltrops
A bundle of spiked stars spread across a tile. Whilst they are far from deadly, they are painful enough so that most creatures thread through them carefully, slowing them down significantly.

### Oil Trap
Wood Log soaked in oil and wrapped in clothing. Causes a small explosion of fire on trigger. Cheap, unreliable and ineffective against fast moving targets. Devastating against slow creatures.
No effect against fast enemies:

Whereas a slow one is quite heavily damaged when we consider cost of those traps:

## Animal Traps
Those traps are focused more around killing and weakening animals. Whilst they can be used against humans, it's rather ineffective.
### Bear Trap
Whilst usually used against bears, this trap can be effectively used against a variety of animals, or even humans. It does a decent amount of piercing damage, and gives a long-term movement penalty but requires metal to make.

## Noose Trap
A noose trap. Whilst damage might be enough to kill small animals, its main benefit is ability to immobilise target for a long time in a noose. Humans are unlikely to trigger it.
