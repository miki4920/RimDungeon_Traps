# RimDungeon Traps
Welcome to RimDungeon! 

RimDungeon is a collection of mods allowing you to play a dungeon keeper, instead of Rim coloniser.
This specific mod adds a variety of traps, so you can embrace your truest kobold desires. Adding your own traps is easy due to a versatile framework available with the mod.

# Traps
But obviously you want to get to traps. At his point, following ones have been created.
## Caltrops
A bundle of spiked stars spread across a tile. Whilst they are far from deadly, they are painful enough so that most enemies thread through them carefully, slowing them down significantly.

## Spikes
Spikes hidden in the ground. When triggered, spikes thrust into the enemy, doing massive damage. Rearmable but is expensive and takes a long time to build. It has a very low chance to trigger on non-enemies.

## Oil Trap
Wood Log soaked in oil and wrapped in clothing. Causes a small explosion of fire on trigger. Cheap, fast and unreliable. Colonists are unlikely to trigger it

## Noose Trap
A noose trap. Does very little damage, but can immobilise target for a long time.
