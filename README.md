## Primitive Traps
Primitive Traps are the most basic ones you will have access to. They require a very cheap research.
### Caltrops
A bundle of spiked stars spread across a tile. Whilst they are far from deadly, they are painful enough so that most creatures thread through them carefully, slowing them down significantly.

## Animal Traps
Those traps are focused more around killing and weakening animals. Whilst they can be used against humans, it's rather ineffective.
### Bear Trap
Whilst usually used against bears, this trap can be effectively used against a variety of animals, or even humans. It does a decent amount of piercing damage, and gives a long-term movement penalty but requires metal to make.

A noose trap. Does very little damage, but can immobilise target for a long time.
